There are three different data types
Strings, Booleans, integers and Floats

Composite Data types: Arrays & Objects
Special Data Types: 

"Strings" - Any text that is wrapped by quotes.
    Examples: "Hello World!" "A block of text..." "4,5"

Numbers (Integers or flotaing point numbers)
There are not quotes...
    Example: 5, 3450.0, -0.000056789

Booleans (True/False Values)
These are special words and not capitalized
    Example: true, false
boolans are typically used to check if something exist or to compare...
dogs = 1 (assigns a variable)
dogs == 1 (check to see if dogs is 1, to ask a question)
true (we get a return telling us dogs is 1)

variable: pocket
reference: acknowleding it is in pocket
return: value coming back to be used

When you add a "string" to a math problem, it will combine the number as part
of the "string"
    Example: "5" + 3 = "53"
             "45" - 1 = "44" ! wut. unless you subtract?

var myNum = 10;

"var or let" used to declare a new variable
"myNum" variable name
"10" right-side expression whose value is set to variable

const name ="wes";
let thingThatChanges ="7"
