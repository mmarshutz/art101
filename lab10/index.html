        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>
          I had many issues with resizing certain portions of my
          nth-child(odd/even) and my buttons which whenever the site was
          rescaled, it'd breach boundaries and look messed up. Though with a bit
          of trial and error, I managed to figure out why this was happening
          (width styling interfering with others).

          Similar to what was detailed in my "Challenges" portion, rescaling
          seemed to be a consistant issue that popped up. I think this is
          usually an issue for me when my CSS gets very long and I forget what I
          added or what's doing what. A solution I usually do is add a thin
          border to see what everything is doing and how boundaries are being
          set.

          Below you'll see a functioning "chat" box that completes both task X
          bonus'. Firstly, the "iMessage" buttons generates random boxes with
          text sampled from a function in JavaScript. Secondly, the "+" button
          prompts a window messagee to add a text message to the output. I made
          it a window prompt because I did not want to rearrange the iPhone
          theme I was trying to maintain.
