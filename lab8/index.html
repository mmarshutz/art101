        <h3>Challenge(s)</h3>
        <p>
          I think it's starting to get harder to understand when to use curly
          brackets, parenthesis, brackets. Largely because the more I add code,
          the more it looks like an abstract piece... It's like a jumbled mess
          that you have to piece together but when I show others, I feel like I
          created a title A game.

        <h3>Problem(s)</h3>
        <p>
          I'm not sure what I got, but I am SICK. Tissues are piling up, soup is
          losing its taste, and the brain fog is foggier than San Francisco...
          Nonetheless, the guidelines, tips, and instruction made this lab
          pretty straightfoward which I enjoyed. I needed something that made me
          feel accomplished and I think I did just that. Not to mention, the
          Task X bonus was needed to provide any content on our websites so I
          was eager to get it done.

        <h3>Result(s)</h3>
        <p>
          A pretty straight-foward wesbite for a "straight-foward" assignment. I
          don't have it in me to beef up these portions enough to make it look
          like there's something worth reading so I'll keep it short. Look below
          and you'll see the results of this lab.
