    <title>Lab 3: File Structure & File Transfer</title>
</head>
<body>

        <h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
        <p>In this lab, I created a file structure for my website that will host each lab and organize them so they can be accessed
            easily.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Getting this all sorted out was an ease, however, linking all of it within one index.html for my "host" site was a bit
            of a maze. With a bit of time and dedication, I managed to get it all together. There is still an abundant amount of
            work I have since I would like to make this part of my portfolio but that will come together by the end of the quarter.
            I am really excited to accomplish this task and hopefully throughout this course, I can implement what I have in mind.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
