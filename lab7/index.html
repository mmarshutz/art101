          I found that the Task X bonus' proved to be more challenging than I
          had intially thought. I managed to only get two of five completed with
          understanding and efficiency. Regardless, the rest of the assingment
          was fun and as usual, I attempted something new with the HTML/CSS
          knowledge I posses. This time around, I replicated the "Hello, my name
          is:" tag I saw on Modes' example which has a fun work around within
          the CSS styling using flex boxes.

          I had some problems that I needed to utilize WesBot for such as; the
          window.prompt function popping up twice which was an easy fix but I
          can't count how many times I touched the function, the output would
          disappear and I would have to debug the code to find out why, what,
          when, where... Nonetheless, WesBot was a huge help and my furstrations
          were limited because of it.

        <hr />
        <p>
          Voila! This is the final result, I had a great time with this lab.
          It's interesting to see how all this works and question how
          programmers can come up with all these functions that create
          astonishing results. Slowly, I'll get there by investing all this time
          and frustration which will ultimatley produce something great one day!
