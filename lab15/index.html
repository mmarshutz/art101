          At first, I wanted to use the Pokemon API but I could not, for the
          life of me, find a way to just source the pokemon name from the API. I
          found a way to use the fetch method but that typically required I
          input every pokemon or create an input field for the user to find a
          specfic Pokemon which is not what I wanted... Instead, I found a dog
          API that generated a random photo of someone's dog.

          I found that using the "recipe" that was provided for this lab to be
          more difficult to use than how we solved this issue in class. Which
          was to make the ajax an object like we usually do with the console.
          Doing this, made it pretty straightfoward than trying to figure out
          where data, URL, etc, is supposed to go.

          Low and behold, the button right below this content shall reveal the
          most adorable, cared for, and extremely happy dogs you've ever seen.
          In fact, you could visit this API and submit a photo of your dog if
          you'd like to see it here one day. You might have to click it a few
          thousand times but you MIGHT just see it!
