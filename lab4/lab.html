					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge... Figuring out the steps! I struggled with determining which steps to implement in a vague but functional way. It's easy
						to get lost in the sauce? It's hard to choose what is needed and what isn't... In regards to my situation, trying to imagine what steps
						javascript would actually need to regist to create a functional game. However, I ended up pulling some resources from YouTube and our module
						to gauge what javascript entails and what steps are likely needed.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have many problems asife from the challenge I encountered but when I was typing my notes in VSCode just to try it out, I noticed that
						unless I specify the file type, it'll try to figure out whether what I am typing is HTML, CSS, or JS which I thought was pretty amusing.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am eager to learn more about javascript but I am concered that this "false-confidence" will prevent me from fully understanding the limits of javascript.
						As I was analyzing this lab, I realized I was getting ahead of myself and thought my knowledge of HTML/CSS would pull through. I see how and why it's an
						entirely different world/class of coding. Better yet, I understand why Wes stated "We have done ZERO coding thus far."
