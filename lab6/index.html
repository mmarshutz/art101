          Ensuring that all the variables, constants, attributes, and whatever
          else is required to create a functional javascript file always needs
          to be defined. Sometimes I found myself wondering why the return
          wasn't working properly until I realized that "year" needed to be
          defined.

          Learning the commands, especially in console, is vital to successfully
          inputing the right content. For a while, I was growing increasingly
          frustrated as to why I couldn't [return] so I could type the rest of
          my function everytime I pressed [enter]. Low and behold, if you don't
          want the console to register a command line, press [shift] +
          [enter]... My temp solution was to type it in VS code and then paste
          it into inspect console.

          I decided to put images of my transportation in another page, hence,
          the images portion of my webpage. Regardless, the output of my code
          will be presented below. I decided to add another mode of
          transportation since I tend to switch between both cars.
