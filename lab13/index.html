          I was mostly pondering why or how I could use this one my own website
          but I may be thinking too much within the box. Nonetheless, this lab
          (like many) has had its moments. At first, I nothing was populating
          when I attempted to run the script but then I found out it was because
          I added a closing bracket to the id="max" which took me forever to
          find and haulted a lot of progress.

          Not too many problems aside from the one detailed above but some of
          the Task X bonus I didn't really understand. One of which was to
          create a form that let the user change the max number of outputs but I
          didn't see how that'd be challenge which got me thinking whether or
          not I was doing it wrong/right. Anyways, I moved on and finished what
          I could.

          As always, the results are presented below! I made some placeholders
          to provide the user a guide on how this code works but it works with
          any word and any amount of factors (up to 23).
