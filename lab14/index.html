          Not many challenges regarding this lab since I think I did a prretty
          good job debugging my JavaScript before each lab was due. However, I
          decided to bring back one of my oldest labs since I've learned a lot
          and incooperate some of the stuff we learned along the way.

          No problems here mate. Just using this lab as a buffer and a way to
          step back and witness how much I've grown and learned this class. It's
          nice to stroll through memory lane and have all this work with my main
          website!

          I'll have a couple of screenshots in the section below regarding
          "debugging." However, there isn't much to add so I'll keep it breif
          and make sure I get something done! The grind never stops!
