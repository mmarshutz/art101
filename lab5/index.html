          <p>
            The terminology used in javascript differs from HTML and CSS so it's
            hard not to refer to variables as elements, or keys as tags but as I
            continue to partake in these labs, I am starting to identify where
            and when to call each block of code. It helps to look up some
            YouTube tutorials and listen to how various content creators
            communicate with their coding.

          <h1>Problems.</h1>
          <p>HOW DOES ONE ADD CSS STYLING TO &#8249;style&#8250; element?! I have been scrolling the 
			internet relentlessly trying to figure out how to make the font size bigger. I managed to find 
			out how to bold certain segments since Wes added a line break tag which gave me a clue, but trying 
			to add CSS as a string made me lose my mind... why javascropt, WHY?!

          <h1>Results.</h1>
          <p>Well, below will be my javascript output, I made a couple extra list that contained two of five cats since they are the ones I live with. Regardless, I tried a new style for the website, experimenting more with flex boxes and how they seem to be the cornerstone of organizing a webpage.</p>
