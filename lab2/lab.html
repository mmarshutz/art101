			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Arr matey! Forge a HTML & CSS beginnin' that be havin' a simple file layout crafted from a .html, .css & img folder. This here'll give ye a shipshape and fundamental webpage. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I found that once there you try to incooperate a numerous amount of tags, attributes, and elements, it's hard to go back. I found that sometimes I'd even add CSS styling that didn't do anything or I'd have inline & external CSS interfering with what I was trying to design.
						I also realized that margin & paddings can get very, very frustrating when you don't want them there and can't figure out how to get rid of it...
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was very, VERY excited to engage with this lab, the extra time we got since the power outage let me discover and attempt some stuff I have never tried before.  	</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					I had a lot of fun creating this website, especially trying out some new things with the tools I used to help me develop this webpage. Utilizing ChatGPT to translate some text to helping me figure out what I did wrong or could expand on with things I've seen across multiple websites.
					Web3school was also a fundemental to creating my navigation bar which I think has become the standard for web development and navigating through a website.
