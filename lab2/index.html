                    <h3>Capt'n Marshutz</h3>
                     <p>Ahoy mateys, I be Manuel Marshutz, sailin' to UCSC as a junior buccaneer! 
                         I've hoisted me flag with Art as me major, and be settin' course to declare 
                        Technology & Information Management as me second major. Afore this voyage, 
                        I plundered an HTML course at San Mateo Community College, where I learned 
                        the ropes o' HTML and CSS styling. But I be admitin', I be a greenhorn when 
                        it comes to the functionin' aspect o' web development, so this here javascript 
                        be a whole new treasure chest for me to explore.

                      Anyway, I be sharin' the deck with three cats that I may upload and showcase, 
                        I just wrapped up a Pirates of the Caribbean marathon (skippin' the last one, 
                       as I heard it be a treasure not worth findin'), and I spend me time on an immense 
                       hunt in Tarkov. Arrr!

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h3>First Mate Hernandez</h3>
                <p>Avast, me hearties! I be Celeste Hernandez, a fresh-faced first mate aboard the 
                    good ship UCSC. I be flyin' the flag o' Art as me major, with a touch o' learnin' 
                    in education on the side. Me compass points toward the horizon where I aim to be 
                    a fearsome high school art teacher, with a wee bit o' an art business on the side. 
                    I be lookin' to sell me own art pieces, inspired by the tales from books and animated 
                    series, to all ye fine folks out there.

                    When I'm not chartin' courses for me future, ye'll find me honin' me skills in drawin',
                    both with quill and parchment or the magic o' digital arts. I be a lover o' stories, 
                    with me nose buried in tomes, and me heart yearnin' for stuffed animals to add to me 
                    collection.
                    
                    One o' the tales close to me heart be the Dreamland Billionaire series by Laren Asher,
                    and the ACOTAR series by Sarah J. Mass be a treasure I hold dear. Me experience with 
                    codin' be as scarce as a mermaid's tears, havin' dabbled in them blocky codes back in 
                    me days as a wee 8th grader. But fear not, for I be settin' me sights on Art 101 and 
                    aimin' to pass with flyin' colors to earn me needed credits.
                    
                    Fair winds and following seas to ye all!</p>
