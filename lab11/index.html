          I tried to make it so that when you enter your name within the fields
          below, it'd also change the "Author:" portion as well. At first, it'd
          replace everything I had in there when the parent element contained
          the class "title-output." However, I thought that if I put that class
          within the h2 element, it wouldn't look like it's erasing what was
          there and replacing it with the output in JavaScript. Once I did that,
          it worked! Now it appears to change the author's name when you click
          submit!

        <h1>Problems</h1>
        <p>
          I didn't encounter many problems with this lab since I needed to
          reference Modes' exammple but once I had the barebones, figuring out
          the Task X bonus' was pretty intuitive. Pieceing together some stuff
          we incooperated before, I just added some more input fields and made
          sure they were still tied to my outputs, both title and below.

    <!--Result section-->
    <div id="result-body">
      <div class="left-column"></div>
      <div class="result-section">
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>
          The results are below, including an output below the title which I
          thought would've had a more interactive element to it if user's could
          change a bit more than expected. By completing the Task X bonus, I
          added two additional fields where the user could also add their middle
          and last name to the anogram becuase that seemed to be some of the
          additional information Modes requested in-class.
